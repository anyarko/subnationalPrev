# 🌐 subnationalPrev R Package

Welcome to **subnationalPrev** 🚀, an R package designed to facilitate the analysis of relational 
data collected from multiple locations. The package empowers users to estimate the prevalence 📈 
of groups of characteristics within each sampled area, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of 
network structures.

The methods require Aggregate Relational Data (ARD) 📊 and the known group sizes for some of the 
characteristics in the ARD. These are used to scale the posterior samples of group size parameters and 
inform the size of the unknown groups as in typical Network Scale-Up (NSUM) studies 🧑‍🤝‍🧑.
